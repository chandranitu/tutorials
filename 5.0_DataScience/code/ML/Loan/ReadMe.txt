This problem is a multi variate, linear regression problem, as mentioned in the problem statement itself.

I can help using python. 

So you can read the file using pandas. The set can be split two data frames one with having prices mentioned, and other without that.
The dataset, with prices present, can be normalised, and then can be split into training and test data.
Fit training data in linear regression model. Test it using test data.
Calculate the performance of the model using the formula provided.

Apply the model to predict the missing values.

Other regression models can also be tried out.
