Attached find a file with tweet record. What I want to do is:

·         Find #hashtags in line

·         Create a keyvalue pair with {#hashtags, tweetline)

·         Send tweetline in parallel to an API for sentiment score [1 for positive; 0 for neutral and -1 for -ve]

·         Display a sentiment score chart on timeline vs #hashtag

·         Also, display all the tweets with its sentiment and hashtag filter
